ðŸ”— 2. LinkedIn / Freelance Bio / Resume Summary Version
Iâ€™m a passionate developer currently working at Wipro as a Network Automation Engineer, with expertise in Python scripting and automation.

Iâ€™ve developed Cortex, an AI voice assistant using OpenAI APIs, capable of responding to voice commands, executing offline system actions, and acting as a personal productivity tool.

I also built a Flask-based video generation app that turns user-uploaded images and text into reels/videos using TTS and audio syncing.

Previously, I worked at LBM Infotech, where I gained experience in PHP and CodeIgniter.

Fast learner, creative builder, and always exploring the edge of tech â€” from AI to automation to web development.

1. Short & Casual Version for Portfolio Website
Hey there! I'm a developer who loves building cool stuff with AI, automation, and clean code.

By day, I work at Wipro as a Network Automation Developer. By night, I create things like Cortex, my personal voice assistant powered by OpenAI â€” it listens, responds, and even controls my PC.

I also made a Flask app that creates reels/videos from text and images (yes, it talks too!). Iâ€™ve worked with PHP and CodeIgniter in the past, and Iâ€™m always learning, building, and experimenting with new tech.

Letâ€™s connect or collaborate â€” Iâ€™m always up for interesting projects!
